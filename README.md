# How It Works
Built in IBM watsonx.ai Prompt Lab: Uses prompt templates to define bot personality and answer style.

No dataset/training required: Relies on IBM foundation models.

Customisable: Update system prompt to tailor advice or tone.

# Do’s and Don’ts

# Do:

Ask for fitness tips, workouts, healthy meals, and motivation.

Phrase questions clearly.

Use the Preview or Webchat interface for best experience.

# Don’t:

Enter sensitive personal data or medical questions.

Treat the agent as a replacement for certified medical/professional advice.

Expect tracking or memory of past chats (unless extended for that).
